# Employee-Mangement

This application is an employee management system that allows administrators to view and manage employee details. It displays a list of employees and provides options to filter them by name or type, such as full-time, part-time, contract, or seasonal. There's also a form for adding new employees and a page where you can view detailed information about each employee, including how many years are left until their retirement. Additionally, it has a page that shows employees who will retire in the next 6 months.

The project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and incorporates Bootstrap for styling. It uses class-based components to help familiarize with older technology that might still be in use in some companies.
